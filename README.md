# smart-appliances-manager-tinkercad

This is a simulation project developed in Tinkercad to manage multiple appliances smartly. It automatically trips the circuit if total power exceeds a safe threshold, mimicking a smart energy safety system.

## Features
- Controls 3 appliances with individual switches.
- Automatically trips the system if power limit is exceeded.
- Simulated in Tinkercad with Arduino Uno and virtual components.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Relays
- Push Buttons
- LEDs
- Current sensor (simulated)
- Buzzer

## How It Works
Each appliance draws simulated current. The Arduino checks the total current and disables the appliances when the sum crosses a defined threshold, and triggers a buzzer.
